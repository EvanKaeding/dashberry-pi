# What is this?
Great question. I'll be putting up more documentation later this week. For now, here is a list of proposed dashboard modules that I think should be built.

+Weather dashboard
+Internal home temperature
+Trimet bus schedule
+US Economy/Stock market

If you want to suggest more, shoot me a DM and I'll add it to the list.
