Set of tools, methods and configurations for building meaningful dashboards with a Raspberry Pi.

# What is this?
Great question. I'll be putting up more documentation later this week. For now, here is a list of proposed dashboard modules that I think should be built.
 
+ Weather dashboard
+ Internal home temperature
+ Trimet bus schedule
+ US Economy/Stock market

If you want to suggest more, shoot me a DM and I'll add it to the list.
