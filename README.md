Set of tools, methods and configurations for building meaningful dashboards with a Raspberry Pi.

# The Problem

I'm always frustrated by how long it takes to get meaningful information from public sources. Whether I'm wondering about the weather, the stock market, traffic or something else, invariably I need to grab my phone, launch some app, navigate to the right screen and get the information I need. Of course, if I'm in a hurry and need to know some combination of these things, chances are I'll have to repeat this process several times before I get all of the information I need.

Whether I'm budgeting, creating a grocery list, or simply trying to get ready to go to the office in the morning, I'm going to need to access some amount of information from different sources to help me make the right decision. What's a good way to satiate the demand for ever-present, real-time, meaningful information?

# The Vision

Dashboards are awesome. They help us drive cars, fly planes, and ultimately make decisions in real-time based on quantitative information. What's more is, once they're configured properly, they just run. No user input required.

An additional benefit of a dashboard is that it remains in a single place, ready to convey meaningful information about the world around it at a moments' notice. There's no misplacing it or worrying about it being tied up with an unrelated task. It just does its thing.

The vision for Dashberry Pi is to provide a framework and set of modules for creating a live, customizable dashboard using a Raspberry Pi.

# Module ideas
 
+ Weather dashboard
+ Internal home temperature
+ Trimet bus schedule
+ Traffic/commute time
+ US Economy/Stock market
+ Package tracking

If you want to suggest more, shoot me a DM and I'll add it to the list.
